# Mapbox Tutorial


## Create Account

The very first thing needed before creating a basemap is to create a Mapbox account. The account is free up until you hit a certain amount of map views. The pricing however is very low and unless you work for a large comany you will never hit enough map views to have to pay.

## Entering the Studio

The Mapbox studio is where you will be creating your basemaps. Upon entering the studio you will be taken to a styles page. The purpose of the styles page is to allow the user to either use a style provided by Mapbox or create a completely blank map. The styles provided by Mapbox are great if you dont want to start from scratch and need something basic or want something a little more creative.
