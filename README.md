# Mapbox Tutorial


## Create Account

The very first thing needed before creating a basemap is to create a Mapbox account. The account is free up until you hit a certain amount of map views. The pricing however is very low and unless you work for a large comany you will never hit enough map views to have to pay.

## Entering the Studio

The Mapbox studio is where you will be creating your basemaps. Upon entering the studio you will be taken to a styles page. The purpose of the styles page is to allow the user to either use a style provided by Mapbox or create a completely blank map. The styles provided by Mapbox are great if you don't want to start from scratch and need something basic or want something a little more creative.

## Creating the Basemap

Once you have selected a style you will be able to modify the basemap you selected. In Mapbox you can change everything about the basemap such as color, labels, polygons, and much much more. Once you have your map the way you like it you simply need to publish the map. After that, you can share it via a URL or get the physical code to be embedded into an HTML.
